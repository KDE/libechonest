libechonest
===========

libechonest is a collection of C++/Qt classes designed to make a developer's life 
easy when trying to use the APIs provided by The Echo Nest. More information about
the APIs can be found here:

http://developer.echonest.com/docs/v4/

libechonest is developed by Leo Franchi (lfranchi@kde.org), and is available on gitorious 
 at http://gitorious.org/libechonest . Merge requests, API comments, and more are appreciated.

Dependencies
============

    * Qt, only the QtCore and QtNetwork modules (www.qtsoftware.com)
    * CMake, Kitware's open source build system (http://cmake.org)

Installing
==========

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/desired/install ..
make
make install

Using libechonest
===============
The c++ API is meant to be as close to the Echo Nest API as possible. All Echo Nest
API functions have been copied into their respective c++ equivalents, and string values
converted to enums where reasonable. 

See the unit tests in tests/ for examples on how to use the classes.

You need an API key from http://developer.echonest.com to use this library. Set your API key
 with Echonest::Config::instance()->setAPIKey().

You can also set your own custom QNetworkAccessManager-derived class with Config::setNetworkAccessManager();

Your link line needs to include the following:

    -lechonest -lQtCore -lQtNetwork

Thank you for tuning in!
